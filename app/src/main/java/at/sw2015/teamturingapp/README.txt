############### RELEASE 0.2 ############################
#
# Second release at the end of iteration 2. 
# Most of the user stories planed for this implementation were
# completed, only missing is the load rule functionality.
# This was not completed due to problems with the XML file handlers,
# which took up more time than planned. We will implement
# Them in the next iteration.
